It's still difficult to believe that I'm living in Tokyo right now. That I've actually moved here. The first time I
tried, was in 2016 when I planned to do a semester abroad at Waseda University in Tokyo. 9 years later, I'm here.

Moving here hasn't been easy. Or let's say, it has been the result of a lot of other things coming together during the
last few years. There have been a lot of valuable experiences at my previous jobs at Deloitte and Amazon that allowed me
to make this possible, to gather the skills necessary to have a fair shot and making this work and finding a role that
fulfills my requirements.

## What I have been searching for and how I found it

I'm certainly not an easy person to please. I had a good amount of wishes for my new job, and some requirements. 
First, I didn't want to work in an office 5 days a week. I've spent the last 1.5 years taking a break in South Korea with shorter stints back in
Germany and the thought of going back and completely giving up that freedom, commuting to an office every day, taking
away precious time of the day that could be used for so many other things that I love, sounded dreadful. Ultimately, a
fully remote role was the goal, but that's not particularly easy to come across. Not that I haven't tried, it just
didn't work out for a variety of reasons. 
Second, I knew that I would prefer living in Japan or South Korea, and over the 1.5 years I've spent in Korea, Korea started feeling like home. For anyone who doesn't know, it's significantly
easier to find a dev job in Japan than it is in Korea, especially if you don't speak the local language which I
couldn't. So the more realistic outcome was Japan, and I loved my prior trips to the country, so I certainly didn't
mind. 
Third, the salary had to work out for me. I knew that no matter what, it's highly likely to effectively be a salary cut
compared to my previous job at AWS in Berlin. That would be the sacrifice I had to make for the opportunity. Still, I
wanted it to be at least 9 million Yen. Why 9 million? Life in Tokyo isn't very cheap but what made my situation a bit
different was, that I knew I would fly to South Korea for two weekends per month, or at least try to make that work.
And those flights would be expensive considering I'd be limited when it comes to the departure times from Tokyo and
Seoul.
