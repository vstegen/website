Let's start this journey very simple. Hello!

I'm Marvin, and this is my first ever blog post. I've never done anything like this before, but something in me is
telling me to start. So here I am.

This blog will contain my honest and fully transparent thoughts on technology, on experience, on travel, on photography,
and importanly on the projects I'm planning on building. A few of my friends and family know about this; let's say in
order to keep me accountable for following through on my words. Will my writing be eloquent, graceful, a joy to read?
Honestly, probably not. Cut the "probably". Definitely not. I'm not a writer, never have been, though I do enjoy
writing at time â€” otherwise why would I start all of this? Wait, will I count as a writer if I continue writing blog
posts?

Anyway, let's get back to the point.

I would be delighted if you and I could go on a journey together. A journey of building all kinds of different projects,
I have a long list jotted down in my notebook, hopefully changing the life of people along the way. This journey will be
intersection with random trips and experiences around Tokyo, maybe a few other countries, and random things that come
up. Matter of fact, this was actually written on my flight to Mongolia!

All of this to say, let's start this journey, shall we?
